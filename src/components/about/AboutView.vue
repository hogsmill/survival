      Th very simple game demonstrates why early and frequent feedback leads to
      success; in battleships, or software development...
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone is familiar with this game - you simply place your ships on your board, and
      your opponent places his. You then have 40 shots to destroy your opponents fleet. Yoi
      do this by clicking on the squares on your opponent's board. In real life, they will
      tell you if you hit a ship or not; in the online version, the cells on the board change
      colour to give instant feedback.

    <p>
      And here's the agile twist! One player plays "agile" - the normal battleships game. The
      other plays "non-agile", and doesn't get the feedback until the end of the game. The "agile"
      player should win easily every time as getting feedback after every move allows them to
      inspect and potentially adapt their plan every move.
